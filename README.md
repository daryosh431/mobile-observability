A Claude Code plugin that gives Claude expert knowledge in mobile app observability—crash reporting, performance monitoring, session replay, and instrumentation for iOS, Android, and React Native.

## Why This Plugin?

**Most teams don't know what to instrument, with what data, to make it actionable.**

There's a fine line between:
- **Too much telemetry** → noise, high costs, battery drain
- **Too little telemetry** → blind spots when debugging production issues

The result? Teams ship apps and then realize they can't answer basic questions:
- "Why did 12% of users fail to complete onboarding?"
- "What was happening in the app when this crash occurred?"
- "Which screens are slow for users on older devices?"

**This plugin helps you instrument your app so you CAN answer these questions** — before you need to, not after something breaks.

It teaches Claude "User-Focused Observability": linking user intentions and outcomes with app telemetry at the workflow level.

Instead of generic advice, you get:
- **What to measure** for your specific user journeys
- **What data to attach** so telemetry is actionable (not just "log errors")
- **How to balance** signal vs noise vs cost
- **Platform-specific patterns** for iOS, Android, and React Native

## Who Is This For?

- **Mobile developers** adding observability to iOS/Android/React Native apps
- **Teams adopting** Sentry, Datadog, Embrace, or Bugsnag
- **Anyone debugging** mobile crashes, ANRs, or performance issues
- **Developers wanting** to instrument apps the right way from the start

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- A mobile project (iOS, Android, or React Native)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the plugin
git clone https://github.com/calube/mobile-observability.git

# Install in Claude Code
claude plugins install ./mobile-observability
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate an Instrumentation Plan

Open Claude Code in your mobile project and run:

```
/instrument ios
```

Claude will analyze your codebase and generate a prioritized instrumentation plan covering crashes, performance, breadcrumbs, and user context.

### 2. Debug a Crash

```
/diagnose crash
```

Then paste your crash log. Claude will identify the root cause, explain what happened, and suggest fixes.

### 3. Audit Existing Telemetry

```
/audit
```

Claude scans your codebase for existing instrumentation and identifies gaps.

### 4. Ask Natural Questions

The plugin's skills activate automatically when you ask questions like:

- "Why is my app crashing on launch?"
- "How do I track screen load time?"
- "Set up session replay with Sentry"
- "What should I measure in my onboarding flow?"

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/instrument [platform]` | Generate instrumentation plan for a codebase |
| `/diagnose [type]` | Analyze crash logs, ANRs, and performance issues |
| `/audit [path]` | Scan for existing instrumentation and gaps |

### Command Examples

```bash
# iOS instrumentation plan
/instrument ios

# Android with specific vendor
/instrument android --vendor=sentry

# Analyze a crash
/diagnose crash

# Analyze performance issue
/diagnose performance

# Audit current directory
/audit

# Audit specific path
/audit ./src
```

## Skills

Nine focused skills provide expert guidance:

| Skill | Triggers When You Ask About |
|-------|----------------------------|
| `instrumentation-planning` | "What should I measure?", "How do I instrument..." |
| `crash-debugging` | "Why is my app crashing?", "Debug this crash log" |
| `performance-optimization` | "App is slow", "Optimize performance" |
| `session-replay` | "Set up session replay", "Visual debugging" |
| `interaction-latency` | "Track button taps", "Measure response time" |
| `navigation-latency` | "Track screen loads", "Measure TTI" |
| `network-tracing` | "Trace API calls", "Monitor network requests" |
| `user-journey-tracking` | "Track funnels", "Measure conversion" |
| `symbolication-setup` | "dSYM", "ProGuard", "source maps", "stack traces unreadable" |

## Agents

| Agent | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `codebase-analyzer` | Explores your codebase to understand architecture and find instrumentation opportunities |
| `issue-analyzer` | Deep-dives into crash logs, stack traces, and performance issues |

**Use agents directly:**
```
Launch the codebase-analyzer agent to analyze my iOS app
```

## Anti-Pattern Hooks

The plugin warns about observability anti-patterns when editing `.swift`, `.kt`, or `.ts` files:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **High cardinality tags** | User IDs or UUIDs as metric labels explode storage costs |
| **Unbounded payloads** | Attaching entire state objects bloats events and hits limits |
| **Unstructured logging** | String interpolation breaks log querying and aggregation |
| **Inconsistent naming** | `fetchUser` vs `user.fetch` breaks dashboards and alerts |
| **PII in telemetry** | Compliance risk; never log emails, phones, or free text |
| **Missing context** | Events without screen/session/version are hard to debug |
